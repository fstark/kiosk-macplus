# MacPlus Kiosk

This is a macplus ZuluSCSI image to be used in a kiosk setup (free use of the computer).

The image is intended to be used with a ZuluSCI in kiosk mode (image renamed to end in ``.ori``), so it is fresh after each power-up. You can let people play with the mac as much as they want, and at the next power-up, it is fresh as new.

The image is 20Mb, as this was the size of an Apple SCSI disk, and showcases what a MacPlus was.

The software that is included in period accurate for MacPlus users (1984-1989).

The image contains:

## System 6.0.8

The latest System 6 for the Plus.

SCSIProbe is included

The first version of After Dark (sorry, no toasters) is active, so the screen doesn't burn out.

## HyperCard 1.2.5

At the top level, HyperCard is included, with all the demo stacks.

## Applications

A few applications are bundled:

### MacPaint 1.5

The almost original MacPaint, with WoodBlock, the famous image of the Japanese Lady, by Suzan Kare.

### Photoshop 1.0

The original Photoshop, with a couple of image from the period: one 8 bits, and another 1 bit scan.

### MacWrite 1.6

As MacPaint is included, MacWrite has to be included too. There is no sample document, but I am open to include one (and maybe some demo fun fonts)

### MacDraw 1.9.5

MacDraw was an impression vector drawing program (well, at least until Illustrator 88), and is included, for the whole trilogy.

### Studio Session

A extremely skeuomorphic music composing and playing software. Chuck Roast is still burnt into my mind 35 years later (and if anyone knows the reason of the mysterious 16 mixing pixels on the right of the screen, I'd love to hear from you)

### Excel 1.5

The Mac was a serious business machine, which is why Microsoft built a competitor to 1-2-3, but in a GUI. This is Excel, it was ported/rewritten for Windows 2 years later.

### Powerpoint 1.0

It isn't common knowledge that PowerPoint was a Mac software before being a windows one. Even less obscure is the fact that it wasn't a Microsof-designed product, but was designed by Forthought...

### Microsoft Word 4.0

For completeness of the Microsoft Office suite, I chose to include Word 4.0

### ResEdit

As surprising at is seems, ResEdit was a common way to spend time exploring the resource forks of installed applications and documents. It is a later 94 version, but I haven't included the dissasemler (I should, or I should downgrade to a 80s version).

## Games

I included a bunch of typical games.

### Lode Runner 1.0

The port of the Apple ][ game. Anyone that tells you that Lode Runner isn't the best game ever is wrong.

### Solitaire (???)

I spent way more time that I will admit with this game. And again, it was before the Windows copycat.

### LunarLander

A graphical rendition of the classic Lunar Lander game.

### Shangai

An addictive mah-jong solitaire game. Almost as addictive as the color version.

### Dungeon of Doom 4.0

One of the first graphical rogue-like.

### Backgammon (???)

The classic backgammon board game.

### Missile Command

A very early classic on the Mac 128k that still work on the Plus.

### Risk

A classic time-waster for eastly Macs

### Mac Missiles 1.0

A harder-than-it-looks Missile Commander clone. But the most interesting thing is by far the name of the developer...

### The Fools'Errand 1.1

An absolutely incredible adventur/puzzle game. There is no way to finish it in a kiosk sitting, but this is an absolute masterpiece.

### Tetri

The classic Tetris for the class Macs.

### Dark Castle

**The** "platformer" for Mac. Beautiful graphics, an absolute classic.

### Shufflepuck Cafe 1.0

**The** action game for the Mac. Purely written using the toolbox, zero assembly. Another absolute classic for the Mac.

### Aitborne! 1.0

Classic very early Mac 128K game.

### MacsBugs!

I spent more time than I'd like to confess on this game. The instructions are made of awesome.

### Deja Vu II -- Lost in Las Vegas

A beautiful, very mac-like, "point-and-click".

### Captain BLOOD

A famous game on the Atari ST, ported to many platforms. It only works on the MacPlus and you may understand why it is included by looking at the Credits screen...
